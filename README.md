## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Thanks to [A Modern CSS Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/) I learned its easier to use images as block elements ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

### Continued development

Going forward I want to continue using CSS grid and CSS animations as I am still not comfortable with them.

### Useful resources

- [A Modern CSS Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/) - This helped me with CSS resets. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
